Work related to EECS 499, a graduate course in robotic algorithms taken in Spring 2017.  Includes two projects using algorithms studied in the Probabilistic Robotics textbook by Dieter Fox and Sebastian Thrun.  

The first project is a particle filter that tracks monocular video footage of a Rubik's Cube.  

The second project uses a rapidly-exploring random forest (RRT) and a probabilistic roadmap (PRM) to navigate two 2 DoF robots navigating a maze together without colliding.

Please see the Particle Filter Report and PRM/RRT Report files for a full technical report, including theory, implementation, and results.
